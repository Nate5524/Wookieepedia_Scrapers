# Wookieepedia Scrapers
This repo houses a couple wookieepedia scrapers that I made to get some data for a side project of mine.

## Installation
This project runs in Python3.
For easy installation of dependencies, run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. Use of a venv is recommended.

## Usage
Each scraper exists in its own .py file. To parse the content the file specifies, simply run the file. It should produce a similar/identical .json to the corresponding one that is already committed.
